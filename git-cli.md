# Git and Command Line Interface (CLI) Notes

## Git

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your codebase. It enables collaboration among multiple developers and maintains a comprehensive history of all modifications made to a project.

### Basic Git Commands:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clones a repository from a specified URL.
- `git add <file>`: Adds changes to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commits changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Pulls changes from a remote repository.

### Git commands in Bash

```bash
$ git clone 'project.url'
$ cd project
$ touch new-file.txt
$ git add new-file.txt
$ git commit -m "Add new-file.txt"
```

# Command Line Interface (CLI) Notes

## Basics of CLI

### What is CLI?

CLI, or Command Line Interface, is a text-based way to interact with your computer's operating system. It allows you to execute commands by typing them directly into a terminal or console.

### Basic Commands:

- `ls` (list): Displays a list of files and directories in the current location.
- `cd` (change directory): Moves to a specified directory.
- `mkdir` (make directory): Creates a new directory.
- `cp` (copy): Copies files or directories.
- `mv` (move): Moves or renames files or directories.
- `rm` (remove): Deletes files or directories.


  ``` bash
$ mkdir document

$ cd documents

$ touch readme.txt

$ ls

$ mv old-path new-path/

$ cd dir/

```
